# -Smartphone-Data-Analysis-Project-In-Excel
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of smartphones to extract meaningful insights and trends. The dataset initially contained raw, unstructured information, which I systematically cleaned, processed, and visualized.

### Project Overview
#### Raw Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Standardized columns (Brand, Model, RAM, ROM, Display Size, Camera Specs, Battery, Processor, Price, Ratings).
Extracted key specifications from unstructured text (e.g., megapixels from camera details).
Converted numerical data types for analysis (e.g., price, battery capacity).

#### Data Exploration & Insights:
Price vs. Battery Capacity: Analyzed the correlation between smartphone price and battery size across brands.
Processor Rankings: Identified the most frequently used processors and ranked them based on occurrence.
Display Size vs. Price Trends: Explored how screen size impacts smartphone pricing across different brands.

#### Data Visualization & Reporting:
Created Pivot Tables to summarize pricing trends by brand.
Designed structured comparisons (e.g., rating and RAM vs price).
Derived insights to help users choose smartphones based on key specifications and value for money.

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and extract insights from real-world data using Excel. It showcases my skills in data preprocessing, trend analysis, pivot tables, and visualization.
